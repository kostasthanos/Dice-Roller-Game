2. #### Set their names on Player1 and Player2 respectively by clicking on them.

3. #### Choose the disired score by pressing the first button (*Winning Score*) on the top right. If the players don't set a score, then the score will be set to 100 by default.

   </p>

4. #### Game starts from Player1 by default when the **ROLL DICE** button is pressed.  

5. #### The active player has a gray background. This player rolls the dice and continues to roll until the desired winning score is reached. If he rolls two 1's or two 6's then he loses his turn and at the same time loses the score he has won so far. To avoid this, he should press the **HOLD** button and hold the current score.  


5. #### The first player who will reach the winning score is the winner.  

Below are 2 images. One is during the game and the other one is when Player1 has already won.
